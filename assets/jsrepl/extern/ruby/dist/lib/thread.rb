# Mutex implements a simple semaphore that can be used to coordinate access to
# shared data from multiple concurrent threads.
#
# Example:
#
#   require 'thread'
#   semaphore = Mutex.new
#   
#   a = Thread.new {
#     semaphore.synchronize {
#       # access shared resource
#     }
#   }
#   
#   b = Thread.new {
#     semaphore.synchronize {
#       # access shared resource
#     }
#   }

#   
#   a = Thread.new {
#     mutex.synchronize {

#   
#   b = Thread.new {
#     mutex.synchronize {
#       # Thread 'b' has finished using the resource
#       resource.signal
#     }
#   }
