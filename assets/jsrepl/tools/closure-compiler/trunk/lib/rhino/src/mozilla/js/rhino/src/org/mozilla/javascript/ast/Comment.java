/**
 * Node representing comments.
 * Node type is {@link Token#COMMENT}.<p>
 *
 * <p>JavaScript effectively has five comment types:
 *   <ol>
 *     <li>// line comments</li>
 *     <li>/<span class="none">* block comments *\/</li>
 *     <li>/<span class="none">** jsdoc comments *\/</li>
 *     <li>&lt;!-- html-open line comments</li>
 *     <li>^\\s*--&gt; html-close line comments</li>
 *   </ol>
 *
 * <p>The first three should be familiar to Java programmers.  JsDoc comments
 * are really just block comments with some conventions about the formatting
 * within the comment delimiters.  Line and block comments are described in the
 * Ecma-262 specification. <p>
 *
 * <p>SpiderMonkey and Rhino also support HTML comment syntax, but somewhat
 * counterintuitively, the syntax does not produce a block comment.  Instead,
 * everything from the string &lt;!-- through the end of the line is considered
 * a comment, and if the token --&gt; is the first non-whitespace on the line,
 * then the line is considered a line comment.  This is to support parsing
 * JavaScript in &lt;script&gt; HTML tags that has been "hidden" from very old
 * browsers by surrounding it with HTML comment delimiters. <p>
 *
 * Note the node start position for Comment nodes is still relative to the
 * parent, but Comments are always stored directly in the AstRoot node, so
 * they are also effectively absolute offsets.
